    "The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a general term for a family of Markov chain simulation methods that are useful for sampling from Bayesian posterior distributions. MHA, can be considered as a generalisation of the Metropolis algorithm for **Non Symmetric Jump Distributions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Gibbs sampling and Metropolic Algorithm are special cases of Metropolis Hastings Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm generalizes the basic Metropolis algorithm presented above in two ways. \n",
