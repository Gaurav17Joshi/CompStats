    "A particular Markov chain algorithm that has been found useful in many multidimensional problems is the Gibbs sampler, also called alternating conditional sampling, which is defined in terms of subvectors of $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first divide the parameter vector to its subvectors $\\theta = (\\theta_{1}, ... \\theta_{d})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration of the Gibbs sampler cycles through the subvectors of $\\theta$, drawing each subset conditional on the value of all the others. There are thus $d$ steps in iteration $t$. At each iteration $t$, an ordering of the d subvectors of $\\theta$ is chosen and, in turn, each $\\theta_{j}^{t}$ is sampled from the conditional distribution given all the other components of $\\theta$\n",

    "where $\\theta_{-j}^{t-1}$, represents all the components of $\\theta$ except for $\\theta_j$:\n",

    "\\theta_{-j}^{t-1} = (\\theta_{1}^{t}, \\theta_{2}^{t}, ... ,\\theta_{j-1}^{t}, \\theta_{j+1}^{t-1}, .... \\theta_{d}^{t-1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We sample out $\\theta_{j}$, conditioned on the value  of other parameters obtained up till now. It is quite useful in multidimensional cases, where the conditional distribution is easy to get.\n",
