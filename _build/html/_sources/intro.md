# Computational Statistics


The books is for exploring computational statistics, and its modern applications in Bayesian Data Analysis. It will also be accompanied by an appendix on Stats and Mathematics, and an entire section on Data analysis and examples on common parametric and non parametric models.

This is mainly for a code based approach to understanding how various simulation methods and statistical algorithms run, accompanied by the necessary mathematics to understand them.

I will also analyse a few recent and important papers in the field.
